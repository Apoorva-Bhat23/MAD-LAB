##Design and develop a "Travel Ticket Booking" app where users can book tickets by selecting the source and destination from dropdown lists (spinners) and choosing the date of travel using a date picker. Include a toggle button to let users specify whether they want a one-way ticket or a round-trip ticket. The app should have "Submit" and "Reset" buttons. When the "Submit" button is clicked, display the entered details on a new screen in a structured format. The "Reset" button should clear all input fields and set the date picker to the current system date and time.
