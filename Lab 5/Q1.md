## Develop an application named "Vehicle Parking Registration" where the user can register their vehicle for parking. The app should include a spinner that allows users to select the type of vehicle (e.g., car, bike, etc.) nd text fields for entering the vehicle number and RC number. Upon clicking the submit button, the entered details should be displayed in a separate view, providing the user with options to either confirm the details or edit hem. Once the user confirms the information, a toast message should appear showing a unique serial number to confirm the parking allotment.
